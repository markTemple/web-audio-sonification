  <h2>Sonification</h2>

  <p>Sonification is the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data. Due to the specifics of auditory perception, such as temporal and pressure resolution, it forms an interesting alternative to visualization techniques, gaining importance in various disciplines. It has been well established for a long time already as Auditory Display in situations that require a constant awareness of some information.</p>
  <p><em>The Sonified audio playback requires Jazz-Plugin - best in Safari or Firefox </em></p>
  <p>If you have a DNA sequence you would like to sonify and you cannot use this site then please contact me. My email address is listed in the following BMC Journal Article that described this site.
